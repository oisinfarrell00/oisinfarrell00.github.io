    Personal Profile
  </h1>
  <br>
  <p class="text">
    I am a third year computer science student in Trinity College Dublin, currently taking part in an Erasmus programme in the Royal
    Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden. I have an interest in all aspects of computer science and hope to pursue a career this
    field after graduation. I have experience in a range of programming languages, such as Python and Java and can work as part of
    a team or on solo projects, either onsite or remotely. From my project work, I have develop a range of professional skills such as
    time management and gathering client requirements. I am hoping to extend my technical and non-technical skills set and am
    currently seeking relevant internships or work opportunities to facilitate this.
