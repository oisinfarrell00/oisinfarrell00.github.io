    Personal Profile
</h2>
<p id="cv-text">
    I am a third year computer science student in Trinity College Dublin, currently taking part in an Erasmus programme in the Royal
Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden. I have an interest in all aspects of computer science and hope to pursue a career this
field after graduation. I have experience in a range of programming languages, such as Python and Java and can work as part of
a team or on solo projects, either onsite or remotely. From my project work, I have develop a range of professional skills such as
time management and gathering client requirements. I am hoping to extend my technical and non-technical skills set and am
currently seeking relevant internships or work opportunities to facilitate this.
