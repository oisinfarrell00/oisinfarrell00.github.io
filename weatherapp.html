<h1>Weather App using React Native</h1>
<p>
    During my time at KTH I had a module called developing 
    mobile apps. The premise of this course was to learn 
    about how to make apps while learning about the distinction
    between a good app that people will enjoy and an app that poeple will 
    soon get fed up with and wont use. Some of the main take aways
    from the course, besides a basic understanding on how to create a mobile app,
    was that apps need to be simple, require as little effort as possible and 
    convey information in a clear and concise manner.
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea that I had for the module was to make a weather app aimed 
    at poeple who use the weather for sport and recreation. The module was more about the 
    making, testing and developing of an app rather than having a groundbreaking idea.

    Above is the finished app. Although there is nothing revolutionary (I have purposely left out some of the earlier renderings) about it I learned a lot
    about what is involved in making apps. I learning about how you can take an idea, build it, get
    user feedback and adapt it to make something that the target market would actually use. I feel a lot more confident now about the world of app development.
