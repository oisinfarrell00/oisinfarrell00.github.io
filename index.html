        About Me
      </h1>
      <p class="text">
        I am a computer science student at Trinity College
        Dublin (TCD). I have just completed my Erasmus year 
        at the Royal Institue of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.

          Sports:<br>
            I played football for over ten years. In this time I captained my team to three league 
            titles. Playing football has taught me the value of team work and communication as 
            they are the key components to a successful football team.

          Travelling:<br>
            In 2018 I travelled to Australia for the summer to experience what the Land Down Under had 
            to offer. I continued to have a passion for travelling and exercised this love by working in America for 
            a summer. I then went on to do a year abroad in Sweden where I immersed myself in Swedish culture. This 
            included a lot of Fika. (Fika is basically tea and some baked goods.) Travelling has allowed me to develop 
            a lot as a person and has greatly diversified my professional network.
