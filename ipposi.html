<h1>Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry - Jury Selection and
    Data Stratification</h1>
<p>The premise of this project was that IPPOSI needed a jury of 25 people to deliberate on 
    whether or not we should share our personal data for the betterment of healthcare. I was 
    the software consultant of the team and it was my job to take all the potential jury candidates
    and create a jury of 25 people, such that they would represent the Irish population according to the 
    last census report. In total there were 6 criteria that needed to be considered when making the jury.</p>

        Above is a breakdown of the Irish population based on age. This was one of the criteria that needed to be satisfied. The 
        others included gender, ethncity, province, education background and opinion. <br>
        There were over a thousand candidates so to select the jury I created a python script that would
        pick a jury based on the criteria needed. I was careful when creating this script to avoid positive discrimination.

        I learned a lot from this project. It was a great opportunity to work on a real world project. 
        This thaught me how to act professionally, how to conduct myself in a proper manner and improved my 
        communication skills. I now feel more confident going into real world projects.
